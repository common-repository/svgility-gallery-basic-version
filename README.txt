The SVGility gallery plugin uses the HTML <svg> tag to create galleries beyond the usual squares and rectangles.

== Description ==

The SVGility gallery plugin uses the HTML <svg> tag to create galleries beyond the usual squares and rectangles.
SVGility is incredibly responsive and flexible to browsers.  You can set breakpoint triggers that allow you to change the shape and settings of the gallery creating a new experience on different platforms.

<br>

All galleries created are set to a shortcode button you click to copy.  Lay the shortcode anywhere in your post or pages and the plugin will take care of the rest.

All galleries set on a base CSS foundation should JavaScript be disabled.  So, don't worry your gallery will still look like a gallery if something breaks!

Why use SVGility? Mostly for fun or pulling off some cool gallery designs!

The plugin current sits on the Carbon Fields custom post type framework, but will be removed in later versions.

== Installation ==

To install the Svgility plugin, simply unzip the folder and drag it to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory via FTP.

***If you attempt to upload the file through WordPress itself and then use the activation button, you will get an error: "The plugin does not have a valid header."

Ignore it and go the list of installed plugins and activate it this way.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you make this plugin?

I was bored looking at square and rectangular galleries one day.  Got curious with the HTML SVG tags and then this happened.  Go figure.

= Is this plugin finished?

No, not by a long shot.  This project of mine is going to be worked for for a long time with lots of ideas and updates coming down the road.

= What are you planning to add in the future?

Not in any particular order:
1. Animation
2. Sortable filter
3. Shape rotation
4. Multi-shape rows and columns
4. Horizontal trim
5. Music/audio embedding for sites like Soundcloud.
6. Gallery generation based on posts or post categories.
7. Preset CSS styling for the SVG tags.
8. Removing Carbon Fields framework.

*Note that the functionality of HTML SVG tags are rather limited as of late and any improvements in use will be based around the World Wide Web Consortium and web browsers keeping it up to date.

== Changelog ==

No changes yet.

== Arbitrary section ==

If you wish to create your own custom shapes you need software that can produce vector images like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.

*Caution: The plugin has no numerical limit.  So becareful not to set a 10000 column gallery or something that absurd.
